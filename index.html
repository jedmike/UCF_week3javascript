        //My Psudo code indented from instructions

//  You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, 
// the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

        // game start, display initializzes guessed letters blank, number of guess left countdow initializes to 9, wins initialises to zero, losses initializes to zero,

        //Computer randomly guesses letter of alphabet

// 3. Guess what letter I'm thinking of

        //Player enters guess from keyboard
        //add guess to guess so far

        //compare computer guess to player guess

// 4. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

        // if e1qual, player wins, increment wins counter, Alert "you won"

// 5. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

        //if not equal, and if number of  guesses left counter is greater than zero 

        // player enters guess from keyboard

        //else increment loses counter, Alert "you ran out of guesses, You Lost"  

// 6. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

        //refresh display
        //Wins:, Losses, Guesses Left



// 7. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

// 8. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

// 9. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

//  Global
